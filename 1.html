    <strong><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" title="all that universe">The Universe</a></strong> is <u>all of space and time[a] and <br>their</br>contents,[10] including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. While the spatial size of the entire Universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is currently estimated to be 93 billion light years in diameter. In various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many causally disconnected[11] constituent parts of a larger multiverse, which itself comprises all of space and time and its contents.[12]</u>
